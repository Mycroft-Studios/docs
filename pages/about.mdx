# About Me

Hello! I’m Kasey (better known as Mycroft), an 18-year-old university student with a passion for coding and web development. My journey in the world of programming began around eight years ago, and since then, I’ve immersed myself in learning a variety of languages and technologies.

## Skills and Expertise
- Programming Languages: C#, C++, Lua, TypeScript, JavaScript, Python, Dart, Flutter, SQL
- Web Development: Proficient in React, Next.js, Angular, Bootstrap
- Special Projects: Heavily involved in FiveM & Garry's Mod scripting and development

## What I Do
I enjoy creating dynamic and responsive web applications, developing scripts for FiveM, and exploring new programming languages and frameworks. My goal is to continuously improve my skills and contribute to exciting projects that make a difference.

## Why I Love Coding
Coding allows me to solve complex problems, create innovative solutions, and constantly learn new things. It’s a field where creativity meets logic, and I find that incredibly rewarding.

## Get in Touch
Feel free to reach out if you have any questions, project ideas, or just want to connect. I’m always open to new opportunities and collaborations!
