# MySQL Servers

##  MySQL-Server vs MariaDB

Most resources for FiveM were designed to be used with MySQL 5.7 and may hit compatibility issues when using MySQL 8, i.e.

- More reserved keywords, like `'stored'` and `'group'`.
- `Longtext` / `JSON` fields do not support default values.
`MariaDB` is **highly recommended** for compatibility, and improved performance (over all versions of MySQL).

## Installation

<Callout type="warning">
    For Development, it is okay to use XAMPP, but for Production, it is **highly** Recommended to install a MariaDB
    Server directly.
</Callout>

### MariaDB Server
<Steps>
    ### Download
    - Goto the [MariaDB Downloads Page](https://mariadb.org/download/).
    - Select your OS, and Download the latest *None-Beta* version.

    ### Install
    - Run the installer that you downloaded and click `Next`.
    - Accept the <LinkButton text={"License Agreement"} image={"../../static/mariadb/license.png"}/> and click `Next`.
    - You will then be shown <LinkButton text={"this window"} image={"../../static/mariadb/setup.png"}/>, just ignore
    it and press `Next`.
    - You will then be asked to <LinkButton text={"Set a Password"} image={"../../static/mariadb/password.png"}/> for the
    `root` user, this should be a **strong** password, as it is the main user for the database.
    - Once you have set a password, click `Next`.
    - It will then show you <LinkButton text={"this window"} image={"../../static/mariadb/service.png"}/>, it is
    recommended to leave it as default, but you can change it if you want.
    - Click `Next` and then `Install` and it will install.
    - Done! You now have a MariaDB Server running on your machine!

</Steps>

### XAMPP
<Steps>
    ### Download
    - Download XAMPP from [here](https://www.apachefriends.org/download.html).

    ### Install
    - Run the installer that you downloaded.
    > Note: you may get <LinkButton text={"this warning"} image={"../../static/xampp/warning.png"}/>, just ignore it
    and click `OK`
    - When Asked to <LinkButton text={"select components"} image={"../../static/xampp/components.png"}/>, make sure to
    un-select everything except for `MySQL Server`.
    - It will then ask for an <LinkButton text={"install location"} image={"../../static/xampp/folder.png"}/>, you can
    leave it as default, or change it to your liking.
    - It will then ask for your <LinkButton text={"language preference"} image={"../../static/xampp/language.png"}/>
    - After that, click `Next` and it will install.
    - Once Installed, click `Finish` and Head to the next Step!

    ### Start MySQL Server
    <Callout type="info">
        It is **highly** recommended to run the XAMPP Control Panel as Administrator.
    </Callout>
    - Upon Starting the XAMPP Control Panel, you should see <LinkButton text={"this window"} image={"../../static/xampp/panel.png"}/>.
    - Simply click `Start` on the MySQL Server, and it will start.
    - Done! You now have a MySQL Server running on your machine!

    >   *Optional*: You can also press <LinkButton text={"this button"} image={"../../static/xampp/service.png"}/> To
    Install it as a Service, so it will start automatically when you start your PC.
